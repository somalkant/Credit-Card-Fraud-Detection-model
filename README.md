# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-model

Problem: This data is taken from the Kaggle in which data was provided which has been extracted from PCAs of the original dataset. We have to detect fraudulents transaction out of it.


Solution Approach: Although the target labels are provided, we will be solving the problem using Unsupervised Learning techniques because in real time cases you may not be provided with target labels to train the model using Supervised Learning to identify the Frauds. We will use the Labels to analyse the performance of our model.Â¶
We have used various clustering techniques such as KMeans, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN and Local OUtlier Factor (LOF) to identify the ouliers (Frauds). Performance of the different model is compared at the end.
